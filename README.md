# tiny-task-app
This an app for write and storage your tasks in your browser quickly

the following link going to app:

This works with the local storage API that our browser has, where our created tasks will be stored which will persist if the tab or even the window is closed. Tasks will be lost the moment the browsing data of our browser is emptied.

This works on desktops, laptops and mobile devices. 

We are working on implementing a login and that in this way we can access the tasks simply with the user and the password created, obtaining the data not from the local storage but from a database.
